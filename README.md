##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> Help from Jordan during office hours.

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> Approx 6

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> 6, I spent a long time trying to figure out a small problem that only required a small change.

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> The main problem I encountered was related to interpretting a string as a variable name. I thought I understood it in class, but I realized I didn't when I tried to use it in my own project. Also, I had trouble with the shiny server disconnecting- I think it would be helpful to show students how to deal with this by using the log to see the errors.
